Hi! My name is Caitlin Coulson and I will finish my PhD in Animal Science - Ruminant Nutrition in May under Dr. Galen Erickson. I have attended UNL for both my M.S. and Ph.D. and I recieved my B.S. in Animal Science from Kansas State University. After graduation, I plan to work in the industry, either as a feedlot consultant or in technical services. 

I really enjoy working out (running, biking,etc), checking out local brewries, and hanging out with my friends and family. My husband and I actually live in my hometown with our Cocker Spaniel, Moose. We are also getting a golden retriever puppy soon! 

My computing knowledge is very little. Most of my experience has been in SAS, but I have only used it for basic coding, nothing complex. I have other computer knowledge, but working in different interfaces is not something I frequent.
